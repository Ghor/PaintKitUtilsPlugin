# PaintKitUtilsPlugin

This is a clientside plugin for Team Fortress 2 that provides some commands that might be useful to War Paint authors, like dumping textures to disk or outputting keyvalues for a paintkit. All commands start with "pku_".

To build, you'll need to set your PaintKitUtilsPlugin/SourceSDK2013.props to point to your Source SDK mp/src/ or other source folder. You'll also need to provide your own libprotobuf.lib.
